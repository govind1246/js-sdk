### Give feedback

You can ask questions, make suggestions, and report issues on Github.

If you are proposing a new feature or giving feedback on an existing feature:

* Explain in detail what you're trying to do and why the existing system isn't working for you
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to understand the specific problem you're trying to address

If you have found a bug and are comfortable using Github and Markdown, you can create a Github issue. Please search the existing issues first to see if it's already been reported.
Note that since CruxPay is still in development, the sdk operation are subject to change, and a lot of code is still in flux.
